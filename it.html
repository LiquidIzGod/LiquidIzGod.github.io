            <h1>IT Support Specialist</h1>
            <p> 
                I built my first computer when I was 10 years old and never looked back.
                I have an insatiable thirst for tech knowledge that started back then and continues today.
                Wether I have a job in the field or not, my vision to fix and creates pushes me to keep going.
                I completed my A+ Certification just out of highschool.
                I worked various jobs as PC repair, theater/home network/computer installation and repair.
                I've worked as an IT Support field tech and built a Windows Server 2019/Linux Server at home as a lab.

            </p>

            <p>
                As a hobbiest I have built my own programs, batch files, repaired windows and other software.  
                I've built my own custom gaming computers many times over.  
                Since the COVID virus happened I had nothing but time on my hands.  
                So I decided to get my Comp TIA Google Support Certficate.
