        <h1>IT Support Specialist</h1>
        <p> 
            I built my first computer when I was 10 years old and never looked back.
            I have an insatiable thirst for tech knowledge that started back then and continues today.
            Wether I have a job in the field or not, my vision to fix and creates pushes me to keep going.
            I completed my A+ Certification just out of highschool.
            I worked various jobs as PC repair, theater/home network/computer installation and repair.
            I've worked as an IT Support field tech and built a Windows Server 2019/Linux Server at home as a lab.

        </p>
  
        <p>
          As a hobbiest I have built my own programs, batch files, repaired windows and other software.  
          I've built my own custom gaming computers many times over.  
          Since the COVID virus happened I had nothing but time on my hands.  
          So I decided to get my Comp TIA Google Support Certficate.
